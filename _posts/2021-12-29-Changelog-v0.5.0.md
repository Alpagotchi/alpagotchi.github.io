- Added **localizations**!

- New `/language` command added! This allows the owner of the guild to set the language of the bot (rn **english** and **german* are supported)

- The slashcommands are updated and propagate over the guild during the next hour, so errors could be possible in this timeframe

- Alpagotchis responses are refactored into propertyfiles, which allows to quickly add new languages
